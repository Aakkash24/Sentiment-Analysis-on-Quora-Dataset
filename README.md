# Sentiment-Analysis-on-Quora-Dataset

This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on the Quora dataset using Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The Quora dataset is a collection of questions and answers from the popular Q&A website, Quora, and it contains a wide range of topics. The goal of this project is to train a CNN model to predict the sentiment of the text in the dataset, which can be useful in a variety of applications, such as monitoring brand sentiment on social media or identifying customer sentiment in product reviews.

The Quora dataset used in this project can be downloaded from the Quora Insincere Questions Classification competition on Kaggle. The dataset contains a train set and a test set, both in CSV format.

This project demonstrates how sentiment analysis can be performed on the Quora dataset using NLP tools and a CNN model. The trained model can be used to predict the sentiment of new text, which can be useful in a variety of applications. Feel free to modify and improve upon the code to suit your needs.
